# Holochain Scaffolding CLI

CLI to easily generate and edit holochain apps.

## Obtaining the scaffolding tool through holonix

The easiest way to start using the scaffolding tool is through holonix:

```bash
nix run github:holochain/holochain#hc-scaffold -- --version
```

## Usage

Refer to [the holochain developer instructions](https://developer.holochain.org/get-building/) to know how you can use the scaffolding tool to create your own apps.

These are the commands that you can run with the scaffolding tool inside of a holonix develop shell:

```bash

# Scaffold an empty web-app
hc scaffold web-app forum

cd forum

# Scaffold a dna inside the newly scaffolded app

# Scaffold a collection for the newly scaffolded entry-type
hc scaffold collection global all_posts

# Scaffold a new link-type

```
